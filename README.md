## Meshes
In Meshes folder you can find  STL, 3MD files divided for each axis for visualization purposes 

## Generating cycloidal gears
Run the script `cycloid_equasion_gen.py` from the `Cycloid equations` folder to get the cycloid equation that can be input into equation curve in Inventor or Fusion.
